        since I got interested in it and{" "}
        <strong>started building my first web3 projects back in 2018.</strong> I
        knew it right from the start that web3 is{" "}
        <strong>my way of making a dent in the universe.</strong> <br />
        <br /> Also, I speak English with a native-level fluency and{" "}
